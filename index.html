    <img width=150px height=100px src="res/img/megamind.png" alt="Megamind Mash">
    <p>Yeah, that's right! Lately our researches have found a weird behavioural pattern in Mash. It turns out that he has an increased amount of intelligence,
        much more than other tiels. He turns out to have rather neutral behaviour, so not agressive but he doesn't show signs of helpfulness either. We are working
        on finding out the exact amount of IQ but we suspect it's over 120.

    <h5>A Brawlout in NymphTopia: 12 casualties and many wounded.</h5>
    <img width=150px height=100px src="res/img/brawl.jpg" alt="Cockatiels Brawling">
    <p>A brawlout in NymphTopia has lead to the death of twelve cockatiels. We suspect an anonymous tiel has hired another tiel to start the battle.
        It was a blood bath and 30 people got hurt, in which 2 got hurt very badly, aside from the 12 deaths. The tiel that got hired turned out to be
        EInfüßler Mash. He is soon to be arrested but for now, NL (C) is researching on him.

    <img width=150px height=100px src="res/img/cute.png" alt="Cute Mash">
    <p>Beware! If you see this "cute" and girly eyed Mash. Hide your cockatiel! Here's why: So, this Mash is seen a Landmark
        By Siri. All Nymphs are running to this Tiel for the ultimate thruth! To expose us! But don't fall for it! This girly eyed Mash will break your cockatiel emotionally!
        We are investigating and Nymph Security has already contained this Monster.

    <h5>Arda hiding in bear outfit arrested. Full story here.</h5>
    <img width=150px height=100px src="res/img/teddy.png" alt="Teddy bear from Gizem">
    <p>Thanks to Nymph Security (NS for short), we have found and arrested the criminal Arda Yildiz. He in infamously known for the torture of the NymphTopia
        with 3 successfull murders of innocent cockatiels but luckily we found him! He was hiding in a teddy bear suit found in the Chernobyl Reactor. We are harnessing information from his brain and we're gonna study it.

    <h5>What happened to this army officer Nymph?</h5>
    <img width=150px height=100px src="res/img/officer.png" alt="Officer Nymph Ash">
    <p>In the image above you can see 1st Lieutenant Derek von Tü. He was recently deployed to the Syrian warzone. His squad (37th Tü regiment) has been
        drafted out of the war but he is nowhere to be seen. The last GPS signals show that he was standing still for multiple days. We think he's captured
        but a rescue squad is on it's way. He is a veteran Krieger we hope to rescue soon.
