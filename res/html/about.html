<details id="summary">
<summary>What do you guys do at Nymph Laboratories?</summary>
<h4>It is our job at the Nymph Laboratories to receive, entertain, feed and experiment on Budgies, Parakeets, Cockatiels and other small bird type species.</h4>
</details>

<details id="summary">
<summary>What makes you so different from other labs?</summary>
<h4>We are much different. See, instead of only experimenting on standard birds, we test birds with mental disorders, unhealthy psychology or unhealthy physique, as well as
    birds that are much more evil, smart, dumb or dangerous. It requires a facility like us to contain dangerous birds and experiment on them.
